# Project DxccResolver

The goal of this pet project is to identify the country ( DxccEntity ), 
and the code ( Dxcc number ) based on the callsign of amateur radio.

The regex is based on the file: http://www.arrl.org/files/file/DXCC/2013_Current_Deleted.txt

I am creating this regex while usgin this to decode FT8 signals from QO-100 satellite, and is not done yet.
